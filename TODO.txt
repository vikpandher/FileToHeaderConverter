TODO: The input file and output file can still be the same file. The current
      check just checks if the strings given for the paths are the same.
      It will fail if for the following example:
      input file path = ..\Test\test_file.txt
      output file path = ..\Test\..\Test\test_file.txt 

TODO: Maybe add an option to force the overwrite of an existing output file,
      rather then overwriting it by default.
